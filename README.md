# Tech Test Workshop

You can pick one of the following sample take home tech tests or pairing exercises to work on this evening. You can choose to do them in any programming language of your choice.


## Take Home Tech Test

Take home tech tests are one of the ways in which companies might assess your technical ability. You will be sent a description of the test and will be expected to complete it in your own time and send the code over for them to assess.

You will typically have a few days to complete most of these tests so do not expect to finish within this session. The aim of the workshop is to plan your solution with the help of a coach and get started.

## Pairing Exercise

Other companies might choose to do a pairing exercise with you either remotely or in person where you will work through a short problem with a developer. This might be a standalone exercise (like a kata or koan similar to the one you see below) or working on a small part of their codebase. Most of the time, the other developer is only there to observe you or answer any questions if you are stuck.
